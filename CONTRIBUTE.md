# Contributing to Mimic Server API ü§ù

Thank you for considering contributing to Mimic API! We appreciate your help in making this project better.

## How to Contribute üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Fork & Clone the Repository** üç¥

   - Click the ["Fork"](https://github.com/anburocky3/mimic-server-api/fork) button at the top right of the repository page to create your own copy of the project.
   - Once done, clone your forked repository to your local machine for making your contribution changes.
   - Open `Terminal` in your system and clone the project:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/{anburocky3}/mimic-server-api.git
     ```

   - Replace `{anburocky3}` and `mimic-server-api` with your GitHub username and the name of the repository.

2. **Create a New Branch** üåø

   - Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

     ```bash
     git checkout -b my-feature-branch # name meaningfully
     ```

3. **Make Your Changes** ‚úèÔ∏è

   - Make your changes in your local repository.
   - If you are providing API Data, create a new JSON file in `data/fileName.json` and enter the data in JSON structure.
   - Open `scripts/generate-tamil-data.ts` and import the JSON file you created earlier like this:

     ```js
     const endpointName = require("../data/fileName.json");
     ```

   - Once imported, in the same file, look for the `generateDatabase()` function and pass your returned JSON in that function's return.
   - **For example**, if you would like to import `todolist`:

     - Create a new file named `todolist.json` inside the `data/` directory.
     - Import your JSON file like this:

       ```js
       const todoList = require("../data/todolist.json");
       // Existing code, DON'T TOUCH THAT.
       const generateDatabase = () => {
         // Existing code, DON'T TOUCH THAT.
         // On returning, just pass your JSON data.
         return {
           users,
           posts,
           todos,
           projects,
           quotes,
           todoList, // <- like this
         };
       };
       ```

     - Now your API can be browsed at this path:
       - https://mimic-server-api.vercel.app/api/todolist

     ```bash

6. **Create a Pull Request** üì•
